          <h1>ABOUT <SPan>ME</SPan></h1>
          <h3>Front-end Developer</h3>
          <P>I am an front-end developer with a passion for creating beautiful, user-friendly interfaces. With over one month of experience in the field, I skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other front-end technologies.

            Besides my technical skills, I also have strong design sensibilities, which allow me to create interfaces that not only look good but also function well for the end user. I enjoy collaborating with designers and other developers to build cutting-edge websites and web applications that solve real-world problems.
            
            One of my greatest strengths is my ability to learn quickly and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and technologies. This allows me to provide my clients with the most modern and effective solutions possible.
            
            When not coding, I enjoy researching, playing board games, and spending time with my family. I am always eager to take on new challenges and expand my skills, and I look forward to using my expertise to bring your next project to life.</p>
